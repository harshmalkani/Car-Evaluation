# Car-Evaluation

## Introduction
• The project analyses the data to determine the most effective car model based on its characteristics.
• Uses Knn classification algorithm with testing accuracy of 95.3% and testing accuracy of 99.1%. 
• Libraries used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.

### About Dataset
• Contains 7 columns each having 1728 entries.
• The characteristics of the car involves the Price, Maintenance, Number of Doors, Number of Persons, Safety, Luggage boot and Acceptibility.
• Here the independent variables involve Price , Maintenance , Number of Doors , Number of Persons , Safety ,Luggage Boot. While the dependent variable involves car’s     Acceptability.
